This is an addon to help raiding Augmentation Evokers with Prescience decision making.

This addon projects an expected future DPS window using data from previous pulls. Starts as a 30 second forward window, but that is configurable. By default only displays for Augmentation Evokers, but can be enabled for all specs.

The plugin itself displays as a detail window, but it broadcasts the data such that a weak aura can be setup to listen to the data. For example, https://wago.io/PWqPPc1Mn shows the data under unit frames.
